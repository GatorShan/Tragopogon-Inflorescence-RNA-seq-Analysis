# Orthologs of CYC/TB1 clade genes in supertranscript
We are using the 13 putative CYC/TB1 clade genes from Liu et al., (2020) as query to identify orthologs in Tdu supertranscripts; then we will assess those genes' expression files in polyploids and diploids.

## 1. Extract SuperTranscript fasta files (from Tdu) for those 11,863 orthologous pairs used in gene expression analysis
Script `` was used.

Output: `OrthologousPair_11863_Tdu.txt`
