## Identify orthologous pairs that are organelle-targeted and have direct cytonuclear interactions


### 1. Extract SuperTranscript fasta files (from Tdu) for those 4,957 orthologous pairs used in homeolog-specific expression comparison between Tms and Tml

The information of those orthologous pairs can be found [here](https://github.com/GatorShan/Tragopogon-Inflorescence-RNA-seq-Analysis/tree/master/Polyploid_alignment/Homeolog-specific-expression_Tms-Tml_Compare)

Script `Extract_fasta_seq_V2.ipynb` was used. Output: `SuperTranscript_Tdu_4957.fasta`.
