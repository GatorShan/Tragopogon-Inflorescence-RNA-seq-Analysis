# Additive and non-additive loci from Tms and Tml were compared

## 1. Description
Script `Compare_Tms_Tml_additive_exp.ipynb` was used, and shared loci under each category between Tms and Tml were counted

## 2. Results

| | Additive-exp | Transgressive up-regulation | Transgressive down-regulation | Tdu-exp dominance | Tpr-exp dominance |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| shared loci between Tms and Tml | 6,881 | 91 | 141 | 55 | 67 |

Output:
  - `Additive_shared_Tms_Tml.txt`
  - `ELDofTdu_shared_Tms_Tml.txt`
  - `ELDofTpr_shared_Tms_Tml.txt`
  - `Transgressive_up_shared_Tms_Tml.txt`
