# Additive expression analysis in long-liguled T. miscellus (Tml)
## 1. Generate count matrix
Script `DESeq2_Tml_additive_count_matrix.ipynb` was used to generate the count matrix

## 2. DESeq2 analysis
Script `DESeq2_Tml_additive_analysis.ipynb` was used for DESeq2 analysis.

Based on PCA and clustering results, Tml_1 is a outlier (see notes in `DESeq2_Tml_additive_analysis.ipynb`), and is removed. Then, the PCA and clustering results showed samples from the same species were clustered together.

For additive analysis, the expression value of Tml was compared with MPV (average of Tdu and Tpr) following the method described [here](https://support.bioconductor.org/p/69104/). If the expression of Tml is not significantly different from MPV in a locus, that locus is considered as additive; if the expression of Tml is significantly different (FDR 0.05) from MPV at a locus, that locus is considered as non-additive.

Output:
  - `DESeq2_Tml_nonAdditive_loci.txt`, contains 1,007 loci that showed non-additive expression
  - `DESeq2_Tml_Additive_loci.txt`, contains 7,949 loci showed additive expression

## 3. Classify additive and non-additive Tml loci based on parental expression profiles
Script `DESeq2_Tml_additive_loci_classification.ipynb` was used for this analysis.

Output:
  - `Tml_Additive_nonDE.txt`
  - `Tml_Additive_DE.txt`
  - `Tml_nonAdditive_nonDE.txt`
  - `Tml_nonAdditive_DE.txt`

| | Tml additive loci | Tml non-additive loci |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Tdu = Tpr | 6,403 | 737 |
| Tdu â‰  Tpr | 1,546 | 270 |


## 4. Expression-level dominant (ELD) and transgressive expression analysis
Scirpt `DESeq2_Tml_additive_analysis_v2.ipynb` was used, and generate the following output files:
  - `DESeq2_DE_loci_Tdu_higher.txt`, contains DE loci between Tdu and Tpr with higher expression in Tdu
  - `DESeq2_DE_loci_Tpr_higher.txt`, contains DE loci between Tdu and Tpr with higher expression in Tpr
  - `DESeq2_DE_loci_Tml_higher_than_Tdu.txt`, contains DE loci between Tml and Tdu with higher expression in Tml
  - `DESeq2_DE_loci_Tdu_higher_than_Tml.txt`, contains DE loci between Tml and Tdu with higher expression in Tdu
  - `DESeq2_noneDE_loci_Tml_Tdu.txt`, contains nonDE loci between Tml and Tdu
  - `DESeq2_DE_loci_Tml_higher_than_Tpr.txt`, contains DE loci between Tml and Tpr with higher expression in Tml
  - `DESeq2_DE_loci_Tpr_higher_than_Tml.txt`, contains DE loci between Tml and Tpr with higher expression in Tpr
  - `DESeq2_noneDE_loci_Tml_Tpr.txt`, contains nonDE loci between Tml and Tpr

Script `DESeq2_Tml_ELD_transgressiveExp.ipynb` was used to assess ELD and transgressive expression

Output:
  - `Tml_transgressive_higher.txt`
  - `Tml_transgressive_lower.txt`
  - `Tml_ELDofTdu_TduHigher.txt`
  - `Tml_ELDofTdu_TprHigher.txt`
  - `Tml_ELDofTpr_TduHigher.txt`
  - `Tml_ELDofTpr_TprHigher.txt`

| Type | Numuber of loci |
| -- | -- |
| Transgressive expression higher than both Tdu and Tpr | 180 |
| Transgressive expression lower than both Tdu and Tpr | 247 |
| ELD of Tdu; Tdu is higher than Tpr | 62 |
| ELD of Tdu; Tpr is higher than Tdu | 45 |
| ELD of Tpr; Tdu is higher than Tpr | 58 |
| ELD of Tpr; Tpr is higher than Tdu | 61 |
