# Additive expression analysis in long-liguled T. miscellus (Tml)
## 1. Generate count matrix
Script `DESeq2_Tml_additive_count_matrix.ipynb` was used to generate the count matrix

## 2. DESeq2 analysis
Script `DESeq2_Tml_additive_analysis.ipynb` was used for DESeq2 analysis.

Based on PCA and clustering results, Tml_1 is a outlier (see notes in `DESeq2_Tml_additive_analysis.ipynb`), and is removed. Then, the PCA and clustering results showed samples from the same species were clustered togeterh.

For additive analysis, the expression value of Tml was compared with MPV (average of Tdu and Tpr) following the method described [here](https://support.bioconductor.org/p/69104/). If the expression of Tml is not significantly different from MPV in a locus, that locus is considered as additive; if the expression of Tml is significantly different (FDR 0.05) from MPV at a locus, that locus is considered as non-additive.

Output:
  - `DESeq2_Tml_nonAdditive_loci.txt`, contains 1,007 loci that showed non-additive expression
  - `DESeq2_Tml_Additive_loci.txt`, contains 7,949 loci showed additive expression

## 3. Classify additive and non-additive Tml loci based on parental expression profiles
Script `DESeq2_Tml_additive_loci_classification.ipynb` was used for this analysis.

Output:
  - `Tml_Additive_nonDE.txt`
  - `Tml_Additive_DE.txt`
  - `Tml_nonAdditive_nonDE.txt`
  - `Tml_nonAdditive_DE.txt`

| | Tml additive loci | Tml non-additive loci |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Tdu = Tpr | 6,403 | 737 |
| Tdu â‰  Tpr | 1,546 | 270 |
