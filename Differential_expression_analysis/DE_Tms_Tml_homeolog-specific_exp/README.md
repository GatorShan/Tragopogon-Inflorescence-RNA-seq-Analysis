# The homeolog-specific expression profiles of the DE loci

How does each homeolog contribute to the differential gene expression?

Script `DE_Tms_Tml_homeolog-specific_exp.ipynb` was used.

  - For 39 DE loci showing higher expression in Tml than Tms, 24 loci were examined for homeolog-specific expression. **15 of 24 loci (62.5%)** displayed unbiased homeolog expression in both short- and long-liguled T. miscellus.

  - For 2 DE loci showing higher expression in Tms than Tml, 1 loci was examined for homeolog-specific expression. This loci also showed unbiased homeolog expression in both forms of T. miscellus
